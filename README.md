## Overview

The **Midi Mind** is a compact, professional MIDI processor designed for live performance, studio recording, and creative experimentation. Featuring MIDI TRS-A input and output with USB-C power, it transforms MIDI messages in real-time using a powerful yet intuitive programming language.

**Key Features:**
- **Hardware-based processing** with ultra-low latency
- **Real-time MIDI transformation** for live performance
- **Intuitive programming language** for complex routing and effects
- **Professional connectivity** via MIDI TRS-A standard
- **USB-C powered** for reliable operation
- **Bluetooth configuration** via Midi Mind Manager app

## How It Works

![MIDI Signal Flow](images/midi-signal-flow.png)
*MIDI flows from your controller through Midi Mind's programmable processor to your sound modules*

### Hardware
The Midi Mind device sits between your MIDI controller and sound modules, processing every MIDI message according to your programmed rules:

**Input:** MIDI TRS-A from keyboards, controllers, DAWs, or other MIDI sources  
**Processing:** Real-time transformation using custom rule language  
**Output:** MIDI TRS-A to synthesizers, DAWs, effects processors, or other MIDI devices  
**Power:** USB-C for stable, reliable operation  
**Configuration:** Wireless via Bluetooth using the Midi Mind Manager app  

### Programming Language
Create powerful MIDI transformations with an expressive rule-based language:

```
// Route piano split - bass and treble to different channels
noteOn(ch, note, vel) & note < 60 -> noteOn(1, note, vel);     // Bass channel
noteOn(ch, note, vel) & note >= 60 -> noteOn(2, note, vel);    // Piano channel

// Add automatic harmony
noteOn(ch, note, vel) -> 
  noteOn(ch, note, vel),        // Original note
  noteOn(3, note + 4, vel),     // Add major third
  noteOn(4, note + 7, vel);     // Add perfect fifth
```

## Use Cases

### Live Performance
- **Keyboard splits** for bass/piano combinations
- **Dynamic layering** controlled by velocity or controllers
- **Effect routing** to different outputs
- **Real-time harmonization** and chord generation
- **Failsafe MIDI routing** between multiple devices

### Studio Recording
- **Velocity curves** for consistent dynamics
- **Channel mapping** for multi-timbral setups
- **MIDI effects processing** before reaching your DAW
- **Controller remapping** for different instruments
- **Automatic chord and melody generation**

### Creative/Experimental
- **Complex arpeggiation** with custom patterns
- **Algorithmic composition** using global variables and logic
- **Time-based effects** like echoes and delays
- **Interactive control systems** that respond to playing style
- **Live-coded MIDI manipulation** during performance
